#### This upgrade is expected to fork Bitcoin Cash out of two chains, BCHA (Bitcoin Cash ABC) and BCH (Bitcoin Cash Node)

The goal of Bitcoin Cash Node is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

## What is Bitcoin Cash?
Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

## What is Bitcoin Cash Node?
[Bitcoin Cash Node](bitcoincashnodes.org) is the name of open-source software which enables the use of Bitcoin Cash. It is a descendant of the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin ABC software projects.

## How to split BCH and BCHA (Bitcoin ABC) coins using official wallet: https://bchnwallet.org
The problem that splitting coins solves, is to make it so you can spend the coins on the Bitcoin Cash Node network without the same transaction also spending the coins on the Bitcoin Cash ABC network. This happens for coins that have not been split, because when your wallet creates the transaction that spends them, it has no way of marking that transaction so it only works on one of those networks.

If you had Bitcoin Cash wallet at the time of the hardfork (Nov 15,2020), you can get two coins: BCH and BitcoinABC. You balance will be dublicated in two networks.
Install the [official BCHN wallet](https://bchnwallet.org) and split your BCH coins.

After the split, you can also use BCHNwallet to send the coins. Make sure you always choose the correct network by clicking the green Network icon.
